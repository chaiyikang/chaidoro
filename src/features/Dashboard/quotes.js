	`In business, each jump from 0 to 1 happens only once. The next Bill Gates won’t invent
an operating system; the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t build a social network. The next
innovator of the same caliber will build something unimagined to this point. Successful
people don’t look for formulas or choose from existing options, they “rewrite the plan of
the world.”`,
	"A need that's narrow but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but hypothetical.",
	"If you have an account and have done some work, statistics about your productivity can be displayed here.",
	"Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it. How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters. I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we consider a normal job in the same way. How grim it would be to commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss—someone who could call you into their office and say \"take a seat,\" and you'd sit! Imagine having to ask permission to release software to users. Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?",
	"Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes.",
	`Startups are very counterintuitive. Whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts. It's like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.`,
	"If founders' instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us (Y Combinator). You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors. ",
	`It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors. We tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that's actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so. Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. And we have to tell them the best way to do that is simply to make something people want.

	So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying "Just..."
	
	Why do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.`,
	`Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. But that doesn't work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.`,
	`Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.`,
	`A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph.`,
	`Stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.`,
	`Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the system stops working when you start a startup. It's exciting that there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work. Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.`,
	`But I would not give in. I would not be a wage slave. I would not take “no” for an answer. I would not give in. I was going to be rich. Some how. Some way. Someday soon. And I would not retreat to the safety of a decent job until I was starved out of house and home. I would not give in.`,
	`But to make the attempt without sufficient passion and commitment, knowing in your hear of hears that you lack the conviction to succeed, risks the suffering of a self-inflicted plague without even the consolations the loot may bring.`,
